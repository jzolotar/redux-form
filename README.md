# REDUX FORM

The idea of the project was to create a form that would allow you to submit data via POST request as JSON to [https://frosty-wood-6558.getsandbox.com:443/dishes](https://frosty-wood-6558.getsandbox.com:443/dishes)

Form has basic valdiation on go and supports returned validation errors.

Project was built with React, Redux Form and Styled Components.
